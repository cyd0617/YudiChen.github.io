              <h3>(Abstract)</h3>
              <p>
                With the rapid development of the Internet and short video, the exploration of the integration and visualization of media content have become a new subject of traditional radio and television corporate in China. Through the way of establishing MCN institutions, Zhejiang Radio and Television Group ("Zhejiang Radio and Television") has developed new video business in the field of short video and live broadcasting, and achieved outstanding results. Zhejiang Radio and Television's MCN relies on the radio and television station's public endorsement, huge professional host resources, through MCN's organizational approach to integrate market-oriented operation, Internet-based content production model, and develop a new commercial realization capacity, to become the overtaking dark horse racer in MCNs.
              </p>
              <h3>Internal and External Resources Integration, Excellent Resources Re-derived</h3>
                 <p>Zhejiang Radio and Television's transformation through MCN strategy has unique radio and television advantages from the perspective of management and resource. Zhejiang Radio and Television accumulated a huge capital, content, institutional system so that its MCN can still win in the starting line even though it has already lost the market's first-hand advantage. Along with the incubation of existing high-quality internal brand, new programs are produced out of the cooperation of the original platform resources and capital with external resources. Strong combination of excellent resources gives Zhejiang radio and television confidence in the transformation into the MCN industry.
                 </p>
              <h4>Decentralization of operational autonomy</h4>
                 <p>Zhejiang Radio and Television loosens operating restrictions to a certain extent in the operation of MCN, decentralizing the operational autonomy of the sub-group and channels to support the interface of radio and television resources and market resources. Through this, Zhejiang Radio and Television links the content production capacity and market commercial operation strategies, opening up new ways of monetization and integration of internal and external customer resources. Specifically, its business model can be divided into two types:
               <br><br>
             First, internal incubation. The main strategy is to incubate from qualitied channel projects, including Golden Eye MCN and Qianjiang Video. The business methods of the two projects are different: Golden Eye MCN was hatched from Zhejiang People’s Livelihood and Leisure Channel ace column "1818 Golden Eye", and then set up Zhejiang Golden Eye Culture Media Co., Ltd., for corporatization; Qianjiang video still belongs to Qianjiang Channel as an internal project group, failed to achieve corpo-based operation. Either way, Zhejiang Radio and Television endogenous MCN has given full play to the creative advantages of the radio and television system and the original brand's visibility and influence.
                  <br><br>
                Second, external cooperation, mostly in the form of capital cooperation. One of the most representative is Zhejiang Bulu Culture Media Co., Ltd. ("Bulu Culture"), by Zhejiang Radio and Television New Blue Media and Simei Media Co., Ltd. ("Simei Media") joint venture. The cooperation between the mechanisms inside and outside the government system links the content production, platform resources, talent IP advantages and commercial operation ideas of both corporations, while integrating internal and external customer resources and developing new means of commercial realization.
